# retail-ml-analysis
Retail analytics project: Python, Pandas, NumPy, and visualization

📌 Overview

This project analyzes the Myntra Retail Product Catalog using Python.
It demonstrates data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to uncover patterns in product categories, pricing, and customer ratings.

The goal is to highlight practical skills in:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

Preparing data for potential ML applications
