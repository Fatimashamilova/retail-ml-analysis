# retail-ml-analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes the **Myntra Retail Product Catalog** using Python.
It demonstrates data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to uncover patterns in product categories, pricing, and customer ratings.

The goal is to highlight practical skills in:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Preparing data for potential ML applications
